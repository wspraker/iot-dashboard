This is a project demonstration for a possible internship opportunity at Secure Process Intelligence. It is a data analytics dashboard that visualizes key insights from a dataset simulating a
real-world IoT sensor payload. It parses a CSV file with timestamped water level measurements for a well pump, and displays useful information in an effective and concise manner.
